Welcome to Tech Savvy Youth's new **Announcement System!**. As you may know, we have been rebuilding our website from scratch since July in order to move away from Wix.

Lets go over some new features that TSY will be adding soon! ETA for these updates is not known, but [Our Team](https://www.techsavvyyouth.org/team) is working on this tirelessly so stay tuned!

-   **Announcement System**: Gone are the days where we cannot release public messages, we can now create announcements like these with ease! In future updates, we will be adding a comment system, likes, writer information links, and more!

-   **Teacher Profiles**: Students should be able to get to know their teacher more! As such, a future update will be adding profile pages for all instructors that can be accessed by clicking their name anywhere on the website (typically the [Classes](https://www.techsavvyyouth.org/classes) page or the [Our Team](https://www.techsavvyyouth.org/team) page). Students will be able to read their teacher's bio, see what classes they teach, contact info, and anything else the teacher may wish to include.

-   **Website Chat**: A long awaited feature will be releasing shortly as our top priority. Website Chat will allow students to message the entire class for help, directly to their teachers, directly to other students, or directly to TSY Administrators. All chat is moderated automatically for privacy and safety concerns. This will replace Discord as our primary method of class communication. Website Chat will allow a greater amount of security for younger students and an integrated platform for all to use.

-   **Notification System**: In combination with the Website Chat, we will be adding a way for students to get reminded of upcoming classes. This may include email updates and DM's to their TSY Messaging Center.
